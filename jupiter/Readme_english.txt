PC 4k intro for Tokyo Demo Fest 2014
by Tomohiro

System requirement
--------
GPU: support OpenGL 3.3 or higher.
(nVidia Geforce8000s series or later supports OpenGL 3.3.
If your Geforce/Quadro doesn't support it, you might need to update GPU driver.
Most of DirectX 10 class GPU supports OpenGL 3.3)
This program is only tested in Nvidia and Intel GPU, because I have only these GPUs.
But I read OpenGL specification and tried to avoid using vender specific functions.
So theoretically, this program runs in any 3D accelerator supports OpenGL 3.

OS: Windows7 or Windows8 (maybe WindowsXP, WindowsVista)
CPU: support x87 FPU
(This program uses only 1 thread)

4k Intro doesn't run!
--------
Most of 4k intro don't check errors in order to make file as small as possible.
*_debug.exe shows same visual and sound and it has error check code and output error messages in console.
